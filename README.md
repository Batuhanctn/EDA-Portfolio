# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) projects. Each project explores a different dataset to uncover insights, visualize data, and, in some cases, apply basic machine learning models.

## Projects

Here are the projects included in this portfolio:

1.  **[Student Performance EDA & Regression](./Student_PerformanceEDA&Regression/)**
    -   An analysis of student performance data, including the development of a Linear Regression model to predict performance index based on study habits and other factors. This project also features a `LazyPredict` implementation to benchmark multiple regression models.

2.  **[Grades Dataset EDA & Linear Regression](./GradesDatasetEDA/)**
    -   Explores a dataset of student grades and builds a Linear Regression model to predict exam scores based on study habits, attendance, and social media usage.

3.  **[Wine Quality EDA](./WineQualityEDA/)**
    -   A detailed exploratory analysis of the chemical properties of red wine to determine their influence on its quality score. This project focuses purely on data visualization and statistical analysis without predictive modeling.

Each project folder contains a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) with the complete analysis and the corresponding dataset (`.csv`). For more detailed information, please refer to the `README.md` file within each project's directory.
